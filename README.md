# InfamyDev
Development Github for Infamy

This was a prototype for a game that I wanted to work on in the Godot engine.

It was planned to be similar to the game Payday 2 but it would be top-down and have hardcore elements.
Those elements were: lose items upon death (only the items you carry into a heist); get hit a few times and dye; and killing civilians grants a higher bounty therefore making easier difficulties harder.

The features I planned to implement were as follows (not counting above features): Heists / Raids system (You pick what you want to play - with infinite replayability); AI Enemies; Advanced and Realistic Gun System (attachments, recoil, etc.); Shop System (to buy and sell just about anything); Homebase system (acts as your safehome where you can customize and test new weapons, access the shop, change your skills, etc.); Skill System (This would be similar to Payday 2); Multiplayer (with up to 3 friends); Custom Mods (with a very easy to use API); And the ability to customize any element of the game (ui, difficulty, enemy color, etc.)

This game was essentailly a testing ground for a game with great potential. Although right now it's just a testing ground for a decent gun system.
