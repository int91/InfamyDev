# Infamy Development
Infamy is a prototype for a full scale game.

Infamy was planned to be similar to the game Payday 2, except it would be top-down and have hardcore gameplay elements.

The planned hardcore elements / features were: 
* lose items upon death (only the items you carry into a heist).
* killing civilians grants a higher bounty therefore making easier difficulties harder (except the easiest difficulty).

List of all other planned features:
* Heist / Raid System - The player picks the level / mission they want to play.
* Multiple Enemy Types - A strong slow enemy, weaker fast enemy.
* Complex and Realistic Gun System - Complete with a customization system, recoil patterns, reloading, limited ammunition, etc.
* Shop System - To buy and sell every item in the game.
* Skill System - Similar to Payday 2's skill system but with more skills to choose from.
* Homebase System - Acts as a safehouse to access the shop, workbench to customize guns and craft items, change your skills, etc.
* Multiplayer - Up to 3 friends.
* Custom Mods - So the player can make their own items, heists, etc.

Infamy eventaully turned into a testing ground for a game with great potential.

The gun system is finished, working, and can be tested by anyone at any point.

The data for all the items in the game are stored in dictionaries based on categories. Guns are stored in the guns dictionary, while attachments are stored in an attachment dictionary.
